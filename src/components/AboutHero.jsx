					<h2>About Inclusion Africa</h2>
					<p>
						Inclusion Afrika was incorporated in Accra Ghana by Joseph Bentum
						and David Rupper in June 2023. Although Inclusion Afrika is based in
						Ghana, it has a network throughout Sub-Saharan Africa. Inclusion
						Afrika was organized because African young adults are facing many
						challenges including poverty, inadequate education, unemployment and
						a lack of capital or opportunity.
